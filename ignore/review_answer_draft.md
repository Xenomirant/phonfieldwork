## Think about making classes

I will keep it in mind, but for the time being I created a function `read_textgrid()` that is more general then previous, since it deals with encodings.

## Creating stimuli and organizing the files
I added `autonumber` and `loging` arguments to `rename_soundfiles()` function. They both can be switched off. The `autonumber` argument add prefix with number (and appropriate zero padding). The `logging` arguments creates a `logging.csv` file with the change correspondencies.
