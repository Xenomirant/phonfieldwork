# For  @jonkeane

## Think about making classes

I will keep it in mind, but for the time being I created a function `read_textgrid()` that is more general then previous, since it deals with encodings.

## String manipulation and {glue}

## Creating stimuli and organizing the files
I added `autonumber` and `loging` arguments to `rename_soundfiles()` function. They both can be switched off. The `autonumber` argument add prefix with number (and appropriate zero padding). The `logging` arguments creates a `logging.csv` file with the change correspondencies.

I added SpeechRecorder (for some reason, I can't install it on my PC) to the vignette. It would be nice to add once an R function that will create a recording script for them.

I added `missing` argument -- this is really nice thought.
