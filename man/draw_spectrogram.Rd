\arguments{
\item{sound}{Either a numeric vector representing a sequence of samples taken from a sound wave or a sound object created with the loadsound() or makesound() functions.}

\item{fs}{The sampling frequency in Hz. If a sound object is passed this does not need to be specified.}

\item{text_size}{numeric, text size (default = 1).}

\item{windowlength}{The desired analysis window length in milliseconds.}

\item{timestep}{If a negative value is given, -N, then N equally-spaced time steps are calculated. If a positive number is given, this is the spacing between adjacent analyses, in milliseconds.}

\item{padding}{The amount of zero padding for each window, measured in units of window length. For example, if the window is 50 points, and padding = 10, 500 zeros will be appended to each window.}

\item{preemphasisf}{Preemphasis of 6 dB per octave is added to frequencies above the specified frequency. For no preemphasis, set to a frequency higher than the sampling frequency.}

\item{maxfreq}{the maximum frequency to be displayed for the spectrogram up to a maximum of fs/2. This is set to 5000 Hz by default.}

\item{dynamicrange}{Values greater than this many dB below the maximum will be displayed in the same color.}

\item{nlevels}{The number of divisions to be used for the z-axis of the spectrogram. By default it is set equal to the dynamic range, meaning that a single color represents 1 dB on the z-axis.}

\item{show}{If FALSE, no spectrogram is plotted. This is useful if the user would like to perform an action on an existing spectrogram plot without having to redraw it.}

\item{window}{A string indicating the type of window desired. Supported types are: rectangular, hann, hamming, cosine, bartlett, gaussian, and kaiser.}

\item{windowparameter}{The parameter necessary to generate the window, if appropriate. At the moment, the only windows that require parameters are the Kaiser and Gaussian windows. By default, these are set to 2 for kaiser and 0.4 for gaussian windows.}

\item{x_axis}{If TRUE then draw x axis.}

\item{title}{Character with the title.}
