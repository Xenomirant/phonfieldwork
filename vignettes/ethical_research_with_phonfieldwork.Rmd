## Intro

This document is a comment on ethical policy for the `phonfieldwork` package that does not have any legal effect.

The `create_viewer()` function that is part of the `phonfieldwork` package creates an `.html` file that contains:

* table with data;
* list of sounds that could be played by users;
* list of pictures that could be viewed by users.

The main goal of the `phonfieldwork` package is to create a tool for linguistic research, so I would like to emphasise the possible ethical problems connected to possibility of putting the obtained `.html` file online. Those problems should be also a concern of an ethical comission from your institution and publishing platforms, probably, they have the same or simmilar set of rules and concerns that I list below.

## Linguistic research

If you collected some data from human subjects I expect that all your participants (or their legal representatives)

* participated voluntary;
* knew the goal of the research;
* agreed on the usage of gathered data in scintific research;
* agreed on the sharing of gathered data among other researchers;
* agreed on the sharing of gathered data on the internet (optional, but important if you want to post data online);
* agreed on the proposed compensation.

This kind of information is usually collected via informed consent forms, where you also specify the form of data that will be researched and shared: raw data (e. g. like audio), aggregated (by speaker, gender, age, etc), anonymized/non-anonymized etc.

So ethical use of the `phonfieldwork` package imply two things:

* researcher will not reveal any data that are not listed in the informed consent form 
* informed consent form does not soppose to collect (or collect with further removal) of
    * information related to vulnerable populations that can bring any possible harms;
    * personally identifiable or sensitive data that could be traced back to the owner.
    
If people subjects in your research are not agree on internet publication of their data, but agree on sharing thier data among researches, you can use the `encrypt_html_file()` function from the [`encryptedRmd`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=encryptedRmd) package in order to make your work password protected.

## Bioacoustic research

It is possible to use phonfieldwork in biacoustic research, so publishing data should also be done with caution. Ethical use of the `phonfieldwork` package imply that researcher will not reveal any information related to animal populations that may bring any possible harms to any individual animal.

## Other ethical problems

Since `phonfieldwork` can create an `.html` with any type of data in it, it is important to emphasise other ethical problems not conected with any kind of research. I think, you should not post data that

* were produced or distributed without informed consent;
* contain, promote, or threaten harassment or violence against other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease;
* contain, or promote suicide or self-harm;
* contain, promote or threaten sexual exploitation;
* contain, or promote consumption of illigal goods or services;
* are synthetic or manipulated in order to cause harm;
* violate othersâ€™ intellectual property rights, including copyright and trademark.
