This document is a comment on ethical policy for the `phonfieldwork` package for R that doesn't have any legal effect.

Since it easy to publish online obtained from the `phonfieldwork` `.html` file , I would like to emphasise the possible ethical problems. Obtained from the `create_viewer()` function `.html` file contains: 

* table with any data;
* list of sounds that could be played by the internet user;
* list of pictures that could be viewed by the internet user.
